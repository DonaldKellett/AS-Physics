The graph above shows the vertical displacement changing with time for a range of $60$ metres for an arrow at speed $60 ms^{-1}$ (modern arrows) that is shot \emph{horizontally}.  The downwards direction is considered positive displacement in this case.  The vertical axis is vertical displacement in meters while the horizontal axis is time in seconds.

\emph{Note: I used ``connect the dots'' approach in this software to draw the curve of best fit only because I don't really know how to draw a quadratic in this software.}

The graph above shows the vertical displacement changing with time for a range of $60$ metres for an arrow at speed $30 ms^{-1}$ (arrows from five decades ago) that is shot \emph{horizontally}.  The downwards direction is considered positive displacement in this case.  The vertical axis is vertical displacement in meters while the horizontal axis is time in seconds.

\emph{Note: I used ``connect the dots'' approach in this software to draw the curve of best fit only because I don't really know how to draw a quadratic in this software.}
